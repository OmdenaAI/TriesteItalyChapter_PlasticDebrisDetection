# TriesteItalyChapter_PlasticDebrisDetection
## Goal of the Project
To overcome the challenges of traditional plastic pollution monitoring, we propose using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. This approach provides extensive coverage, frequent updates, and high-resolution multispectral images to monitor large areas and identify pollution hotspots.

Sentinel-2 satellites can cover vast regions and detect large plastic debris patches on the surface with up to 10-meter resolution. With a revisit time of approximately 5 days, they offer continuous monitoring and timely detection of pollution changes. The accessibility of free Sentinel-2 data also promotes widespread use and collaboration.

By leveraging Sentinel-2 imagery, we aim to create a reliable tool for tracking superficial plastic debris. This will help assess pollution patterns and inform mitigation strategies, improving plastic pollution monitoring in the Italian and Mediterranean seas and preserving marine biodiversity.
